            The One Feature I Miss The Most In Fire Emblem: Pair-Ups
        </h1>
        <p>
            Itâ€™s been almost six years since the release of Fire Emblem Three Houses. Seven since the release of the last 3DS game, Fire Emblem Revelations. What was once an IP on the fringe of certain death, was saved by the glorious display that was Fire Emblem Awakening on the 3DS. Fire Emblem Awakening not only saved the Fire Emblem IP from being gone for good, but it completely revitalized the series, and several games have been made since Awakening.

            What about Fire Emblem Awakening was SO enticing to masses that wasn't there before? Was it the support system? The engrossing story? Or, perhaps, the lucrative Lunatic+ difficulty that made the game impossibly hard?

            The answer is actually  <s>the dating simulator.</s> convoluted, and subjective at best. However, I propose that it was the sense of creation you got in the game. The sense of creation that you got through your supports, and the child units that you create.
